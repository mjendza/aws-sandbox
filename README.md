# my-aws-sandbox

## TD/TR

This is my sandbox AWS Serverless stack.

## Diagram

`TODO`

## Limitations

This is single repository stack. In one place and as single CDK deployment we are creating all is needed to deliver working application.

## AWS

-   CDK
-   Lambda
-   API Gateway
-   DynamoDB
-   X-RAY
-   CloudWatch

## TypeScript

-   prettier
-   eslint
-   jest

## thanks

üç∫üç∫üç∫ for [Oskar Dudycz](https://github.com/oskardudycz) for [the template](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NodeJS) to the project:

-   Github Action configuration
-   node.js configuration (prettier, eslint, tsconfig)

## Build

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
npm install
npm run build:ts
```

This will install the necessary CDK, then this example's dependencies, and then build your TypeScript files and your CloudFormation template.

## Deploy

$ cdk ls
<list all stacks in this program>

$ cdk synth
<generates and outputs cloudformation template>

$ cdk deploy
<deploys stack to your account>

$ cdk diff
<shows diff against deployed stack>

## Development

### CDK

#### add new resources

1. Extend the CdkResources class with new item based on the convention
1. Implement resources instance for CdkResources with new item name
1. use `generateResourceName` function to generate the resource name based on the convention

#### enable traceability for each resource:

-   for RestApi
-   for lambda please use `lambdaFactory` helper to generate CDK lambda with all needed setup

| :cloud: DynamoDB         | The context for demo service is users. To minimize latency to 80% cases (read by key) the best fit is use DynamoDB storage.

## Architecture

### Lambda

#### helpers

##### dynamodb-factory

-   creates the document client for DynamoDB
-   wrap client with X-RAY

```javascript
function dynamoClient(region?: string): DynamoDB.DocumentClient
```

### CDK

#### cdk-helpers

##### lambdaFactory

-   returns Function with default values
-   based on the convention uses `handler: 'index.handler'`

#### webpack

Handlers located in `handlers` folder, each in a dedicated folder with the name as `index.ts`.
Use `npm run build` to make the deployment handler for CDK.
