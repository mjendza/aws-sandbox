# my-aws-sandbox

## TD/TR

This is my sandbox AWS Serverless stack.

## Big Picture

![big-picture](doc/solution/big-picture.png)

## Limitations

This is single repository stack. In one place and as single CDK deployment we are creating all is needed to deliver working application.

AWS vendor locked-in

## AWS

-   CDK
-   Lambda
-   API Gateway
-   DynamoDB
-   X-RAY
-   CloudWatch

## TypeScript

-   prettier (clean code)
-   eslint (perfect code)
-   jest (tested)
-   ajv (validated data structures)

## thanks

üç∫üç∫üç∫ for [Oskar Dudycz](https://github.com/oskardudycz) for [the template](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NodeJS) to the project:

-   Github Action configuration
-   node.js configuration (prettier, eslint, tsconfig)

## Build

```bash

npm install
npm run build:ts
```

This will install the necessary CDK, then this example's dependencies, and then build your TypeScript files and your CloudFormation template.

## Deploy

### Prerequisites

```
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

### Deployment needed commands

$ cdk ls
<list all stacks in this program>

$ cdk synth
<generates and outputs cloudformation template>

$ cdk deploy
<deploys stack to your account>

$ cdk diff
<shows diff against deployed stack>

## Development

### CDK

#### add new resources

1. Extend the CdkResources class with new item based on the convention
1. Implement resources instance for CdkResources with new item name
1. use `generateResourceName` function to generate the resource name based on the convention

#### enable traceability for each resource:

-   for RestApi
-   for lambda please use `lambdaFactory` helper to generate CDK lambda with all needed setup

#### automatic tests

For now, we support a humao.rest-client with VS code HTTP tests.
Please remember for automatic and manual test -> to not spam PROD environment use **automatic-test** for \*_requestId_ header.

## architecture

### lambda

The lambda is written in N-Layer. This is a microservice, so logic should be so 'easy' and hope in this can be migrated without any refactoring into hexagonal architecture.  
On the picture there is a flow inside the lambda. There is a Service Layer with the dedicated model from the Lambda event. For the persistence layer is a repository to communicate (makes) requests to the DynamoDB.

![n-layer](doc/solution/lambda-architecture-Lambda_Architecture_N_Layer.png)

#### helpers

##### dynamodb-factory

-   creates the document client for DynamoDB
-   wrap client with X-RAY

```javascript
function dynamoClient(region?: string): DynamoDB.DocumentClient
```

### CDK

#### cdk-helpers

##### lambdaFactory

-   returns Function with default values
-   based on the convention uses `handler: 'index.handler'`

#### webpack

Handlers located in `handlers` folder, each in a dedicated folder with the name as `index.ts`.
Use `npm run build` to make the deployment handler for CDK.

##### development configuration

```javascript
    mode: "development",
    optimization: {
        minimize: false,
        usedExports: true,
    },
```

##### production configuration

```javascript
 mode: 'production',
```

##### check the lambda package size

enable plugin

```javascript
    plugins: [
        new BundleAnalyzerPlugin()
    ],
```
