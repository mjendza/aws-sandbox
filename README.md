## thanks

üç∫üç∫üç∫ for [Oskar Dudycz](https://github.com/oskardudycz) for [the template](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NodeJS) to the project:

-   Github Action configuration
-   node.js configuration (prettier, eslint, tsconfig)

## Build

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
npm install
npm run build:ts
```

This will install the necessary CDK, then this example's dependencies, and then build your TypeScript files and your CloudFormation template.

## Deploy

$ cdk ls
<list all stacks in this program>

$ cdk synth
<generates and outputs cloudformation template>

$ cdk deploy
<deploys stack to your account>

$ cdk diff
<shows diff against deployed stack>

## Development

### CDK

#### add new resources

1. Extend the CdkResources class with new item based on the convention
1. Implement resources instance for CdkResources with new item name
1. use `generateResourceName` function to generate the resource name based on the convention

| :hammer: Typescript    | Typescript is awesome :heart: language for microservices (Typesafe and for small size of the repositories is maintainable). Very fast for prototyping and delivering simple solution. | 21.03.2021 [PR1](https://github.com/mjendza/aws-sandbox/pull/1) |
| :cloud: CDK            | We can define deployment with the Typescript language and forget about YAML or JSON.                                                                                                  | 21.03.2021 [PR1](https://github.com/mjendza/aws-sandbox/pull/1) |
